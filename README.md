# React Static Website
Nothing fancy, just my first website with React.

## How to run :
+ npm install
+ npm run dev

The web server should be available at http://localhost:5173/react-static/

## Stack :
+ Vite to launch and configure local server and to bundle source files.
+ React to design components.
+ JS
+ CSS vanilla
+ HTML5

## What I've learned :
+ Startup a project with vite (and yes it's fast);
+ Create a static website with React;
+ Deployed on GitHub Pages;

## What I've continued to learn :
+ git usage,
+ css,
+ html,
+ js,
